# Build a Simple Banking Front End in Half a Day

Original front end demo by [vppmatt](https://github.com/vppmatt)

Each folders represents a checkpoint in the process of building a single front end. The final folder (7-callback-functions) contains the finished front end.
Inspired by a problem-based learning approach, TypeScript fundamentals are not covered in isolation, but introduced when they become necessary to the task at hand.
Comments in the code signify the introduction of a new TypeScript concept.
