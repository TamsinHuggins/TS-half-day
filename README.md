# Build a Simple Banking Front End in Half a Day

Original front end demo by [vppmatt](https://github.com/vppmatt)

### Overview
Each folders represents a checkpoint in the process of building a single front end. The final folder (7-callback-functions) contains the finished front end.
Inspired by a problem-based learning approach, TypeScript fundamentals are not covered in isolation, but introduced when they become necessary to the task at hand.
Comments in the code signify the introduction of a new TypeScript concept.

### How to Use
Use the TypeScript code in the day1.ts file to copy from as you build a new app from scratch.
In order to view how the front end should behave at different stages of the process, in any of the 'checkpoint' folders compile the day1.ts file using

```
tsc day1.ts
```

Then click Go Live (live-server extension) over index.html.
